88) Discuss why it is important to remove multivalued attributes from a relation.
Answer:  A multivalued attribute is one that can take on more than one value. According to the definition of a relation, there can be no multivalued attributes. The reason for this will be seen later when the schema is normalized. A multivalued attribute can be resolved by creating a separate instance for each value and repeating the data from the non-multivalued attributes.

90) Explain what a candidate key is and how it might be used.
Answer:  A candidate key is an attribute or a combination of attributes that uniquely identifies a row in a relation. A candidate key must be nonredundant and must also uniquely identify each row. When we look at functional dependencies and candidate keys, we can always say that a determinant is always a candidate key.

91) Discuss how you would map a regular entity to a relation.
Answer:  Each regular entity is transformed into a relation. There are a couple of things that need to be done with some special types of attributes. Composite attributes are broken down into their individual components. Multivalued attributes are broken down into separate relations. For example, if there was a multivalued skill attribute, this would become a skill relation. Also, we ignore derived attributes.

92) How do you convert weak entities to relations?
Answer:  A weak entity becomes a relation. However, since a weak entity instance does not exist by itself, we must create a relation with the primary key from the strong relation as the primary key, as well as the identifying attribute.

93) Discuss when it is best to create a surrogate key for an associative entity.
Answer:  A surrogate key should be created when any of the following conditions hold: there is a composite primary key, the natural primary key is inefficient (such as a long name), or the natural primary key is recycled. When you have an associative entity, it is often best to use a surrogate key when you have more than two relations that the associative entity is related to, since the primary key would be a composite of the primary keys of all entities related to the associative entity.

94) Discuss the two possible scenarios when mapping an associative entity.
Answer:  There are two possible cases for associative entities. In one case, you can have an identifier assigned. You would then use this as the primary key. The other case is where the identifier is not assigned. In this case, you would use the primary keys from the other two (or more) relations that are related to the associative entity.

95) Discuss how to map a unary one-to-many relationship.
Answer:  The entity type in the unary relationship is mapped to a relation in the same way as we did for a relation. We next add a foreign key attribute, which maps back to the primary key. This is called a recursive foreign key. So, if we had a relation such as a person supervises one or more persons, the person_id would be a primary key and then there would be a supervisor id which points back to the person_id.

96) Discuss how to map a unary many-to-many relationship.
Answer:  Two relations are created. One represents the entity type in the relationship, and the other is an associative relation to represent the M:N relationship. The primary key of the associative relation consists of two attributes which take their value from the primary key of the other relation.

97) Explain how subtype/supertype relationships are converted to relations.
Answer:  When we have a supertype/subtype relationship, we need to assign one entity for the supertype and one for each subtype. The supertype has all attributes common to all subtypes as well as a primary key. Each subtype relation has the primary key of the supertype as well as any attributes that are specific to that subtype. Finally, we assign one or more attributes to the supertype to function as subtype discriminators.

98) Discuss the types of integrity constraints.
Answer:  The three major types of integrity constraints are domain constraints, entity integrity, and referential integrity. A domain is a set of attributes assigned to an attribute and consists of the domain name, data type, size, and allowable values. The entity integrity rule is designed to ensure that every relation has a primary key and that the data values for the primary key are valid (in particular, not null). The referential integrity constraint is a rule that maintains consistency among the rows of two relations. If there is a foreign key in one relation, there must be a matching primary key in the other relation or the foreign key must be null.

99) What is an anomaly, and what are the three types of anomalies?
Answer:  An anomaly is an error or inconsistency that may result when a user attempts to update a table that contains redundant data. There are three types of anomalies. An insert anomaly occurs when a user attempts to enter new information for part of a table. For example, if we stored customer address with an order. A deletion anomaly occurs when the user wants to delete part of a record but also has to delete related data. A modification anomaly occurs when we have to change the same data in multiple places.

100) Discuss the two major occasions when you benefit from using normalization.
Answer:  During logical database design, normalization is used as a check and balance to make sure that your E-R diagram is correct as well as your relational schema before doing physical design. Another occasion when you benefit is reverse-engineering an older system, since many of the tables and user views are redundant.

101) List and explain 1st, 2nd, 3rd, BCNF, 4th, and 5th normal forms.
Answer:  There are six different normal forms, all of which build upon each other. When a relation is in first normal form, all repeating groups have been removed. Second normal form means that any partial functional dependencies have been removed. A partial functional dependency occurs when a primary key is a composite key and a nonkey attribute is dependent upon part of the key. A relation is in third normal form when all transitive dependencies have been resolved. A transitive dependency occurs when one nonkey attribute is dependent upon another nonkey attribute. Boyce-Codd normal form removes any further dependencies that may result from anomalies. A relation is in fourth normal form when any dependencies from multivalued attributes have been removed. Fifth normal form removes any further anomalies.

86) Explain how middleware is used in a two-tier application.
Answer:  Middleware is any class of software that allows an application to interoperate with other software without requiring the user to understand and code the low-level operations required for the interoperability. Database-related middleware consists of an application programmer interface (API) which allows a programmer to connect to an instance of a database. Some examples of these are ODBC, ADO.net, and JDBC. The second type of database middleware is a database driver, which is specific to the database that is being accessed. When middleware is used, there are six basic steps to access a database from within an application:
1. Identify and register a database driver
2. Open a connection to the database
3. Execute a query against the database
4. Process the results of the query
5. Repeats steps 3-4 as needed
6. Close the database connection

147) Discuss coding techniques and how they could be used.
Answer:  Coding techniques are used in cases when attributes have a sparse set of values or have large values which would negatively impact storage space. In this case, one can translate the values into codes. For example, one may have a list of colors for a car, which would have a limited number of values. In this case, one could create a lookup table for color and then replace the value for color with a code.

148) Discuss how data integrity can be controlled.
Answer:  In many database management systems, data integrity controls can be built into the field. The data type is one integrity control. Another integrity control is default values, where one specifies the value that the field will take if no data has been entered. Range control is another data integrity constraint which indicates the upper and lower bounds for the field. Null value control allows one to specify whether null values are allowed or not in the field. Finally, referential integrity ensures that any value entered into a foreign key must have a corresponding value in the primary key of the related table. This ensures that there are no misplaced values in the foreign key.

149) How are missing values generally handled in database management systems?
Answer:  When dealing with missing data, there are many options. Two integrity controls (default value and null control) will handle this problem. One also could substitute an estimate for the missing value which would then be stored in place of the missing value (and marked as an estimate). Another possible method is to use triggers to track missing values and create a log which can be viewed later. One other method is to perform sensitivity testing, which will tell us whether having missing data greatly impacts results. If results are not impacted, then the missing values are ignored.

151) Explain what a tablespace is and how it is used.
Answer:  A tablespace is a named logical storage unit in which data from one or more tables, views, and indexes can be stored. A tablespace is mapped to one or more physical files in the OS and can be set to increase in size automatically. A tablespace can, in many ways, be thought of as its own file system available to the RDBMS.

152) What is a hashing algorithm and how is it used in hashed file organizations?
Answer:  A hashing algorithm is a routine which converts a primary key value into a record address. Hashing algorithms are typically mathematical routines which perform computations such as dividing a primary key by a prime number and then using the remainder for a storage location. The hashing algorithm is used in a file organization to determine where to store the record. One limitation of this is that only one key value can be used for an index.

153) What is clustering?
Answer:  Clustering is a technique used in some database management systems (such as Oracle) to allow adjacent secondary memory space to contain rows from several tables. A cluster is defined by the tables used as well as the column or columns used for clustering. To create a cluster in Oracle, for example, we would create a cluster first with a create cluster command and then reference the cluster when we create each individual table.

154) Explain the differences between sequential and indexed file organizations. 
Answer:  In sequential file organization, the records are stored sequentially according to a primary key value. In index file organizations, the records are stored either sequentially or non-sequentially. An index is created that allows the application software to locate individual records. The index can be thought of as a card catalog.

Difficulty:  Easy

AACSB:  Information Technology

155) Explain what primary, secondary and unique key indexes are.
Answer:  A primary key index is automatically generated when a table is created (provided that a primary key is specified). The primary key index identifies uniquely each row of the table. Thus, there is one entry in the primary key index for each row. A unique key index is similar, except that we have to define this with a separate create index command. A secondary key is nonunique. So, for example, we might create a secondary index on state. Since many records would have the same state, this is non-unique.

156) Discuss when it is best to use indexes.
Answer:  One should always specify a primary key index for each table. Also, indexes are most useful on larger tables. Columns that frequently appear in WHERE clauses of SQL statements are good candidates for indexes, as well as those fields referenced by WHERE clauses and GROUP BY clauses. Any field where there is a wide variety of values is also a good candidate. One should use caution when creating indexes, however, since indexes do require overhead and must be updated for each insert, delete and update. This can cause significant overhead if there are a large number of transactions taking place against the database.

157) Discuss three possible opportunities for denormalization.
Answer:  There are several possible situations when denormalization makes sense. When we have two entities with a one-to-one relationship and high access frequency between them, then it makes sense to combine them into one entity. If one entity is optional, then there will be fields with null values in the combined entity.
Another scenario is when you have an associative entity with nonkey attributes. If there is a high frequency of join operations between the entities, it might be more efficient to combine the associative entity with one of the other entities.
The third case is reference data. If we have a 1:M relationship and the entity on the one side does not participate in any other relationships, then it might be wise to merge the entities.

158) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of partitioning.
Answer:  Partitioning data has several advantages. First, queries are more efficient since data queried together are stored close to one another. Also, each partition of data can be stored in such a way as to optimize its own use. Partitioned data is more secure, since it is much easier to isolate data and make it available only to a group of users. Since smaller files take less time to backup and recover, it is easier to keep a partitioned database up and running. Also, the effects of damage are isolated, since other files (partitions) may not be affected by one damaged file. It is also easier to load balance, since the smaller files can be spread across multiple disks.
Some disadvantages include inconsistent access speed. Different partitions may have different access times, depending upon physical storage of the file. Also, partitioning adds complexity for the programmer. Although to the user, partitioning appears transparent, this is often not the case for a programmer. Finally, data may be replicated across multiple partitions, which will require more storage space and possibly more time for updates.

159) When would you use horizontal partitioning, and when would you use vertical partitioning?
Answer:  Horizontal partitioning is best used when different categories of rows are processed differently. For example, if you would like to have a report for each region, then it might make sense to partition the data by region. This type of partitioning will increase query performance. Horizontal partitioning is most often done by using a single column value or a date.
Vertical partitioning splits up the columns of a table, repeating the primary key. This would best be used for only allowing access by a group of users to a portion of the data. Of course, in both cases, tables could be joined to retrieve all data.

160) What is parallel query processing and how is it useful?
Answer:  Since many of today's computers have either multiple processors or multi-core processors, many database management systems have introduced parallel query processing. With parallel query processing, a query can be broken apart and partitions can be run separately on each processor. The partitions have to be defined in advance by the database designer. The advantage to parallel query processing is speed, since the query can be done in much less time in parallel. The query has to be tuned to achieve the best degree of parallelism.

161) Why would you want to override automatic query optimization?
Answer:  Sometimes, the query designer may know information that can be overlooked by the query optimizer. Often, in the course of testing queries, one may find that it is actually faster not to use a certain index or to use a different index. When this is the case, database management systems such as Oracle include a facility to override the query optimizer, called query hints.

163) What are the most important security features for data management software?
Answer:  The most important security features of data management software are:
1. Views or subschemas. These restrict user views of the database.
2. Integrity controls such as domains, assertions, checks, etc.
3. Authorization rules which identify users and restrict the actions they may take against a database
4. User-defined procedures which define additional constraints
5. Encryption procedures which encode data in an unrecognizable form
6. Authentication schemas–positively identify individuals trying to gain access to the database

164) What are integrity controls? Describe the different types.
Answer:  Integrity controls protect data from unauthorized use and update. One form of an integrity control is a domain, which is like a user-define data type. Once the domain has been created, any field can be assigned that domain as its datatype. The domain definition need only be changed in one place if the domain does change. Assertions are constraints that enforce certain database conditions. For example, an assertion might be used to make sure that someone is not married to themselves. Finally, triggers can be used as an integrity control. For example, we might want to log changes to a table or prevent certain changes.

1. A data warehouse centralizes data that may reside on several different systems.
2. A properly designed data warehouse improves the quality and consistency of data.
3. Contention for resources can be reduced by separating the informational system from the operational system.

128) Explain the four basic steps to build an independent data mart.
Answer:  1. Extraction–data are extracted from internal and external source system files and databases.
2. Transformation and loading–data are transformed, integrated and loaded.
3. At this point, data warehouse is a set of physically distinct databases.
4. Users access the data warehouse using query language and tools.

129) Discuss the limitations of the independent data mart architecture.
Answer:  There are several limitations to the independent data mart including:
1. A separate ETL process for each data mart.
2. Inconsistencies between data marts because they are developed with different technologies sometimes.
3. It is difficult to relate data across data marts.
4. Scaling costs are excessive. Every new application that creates a separate data mart repeats the ETL process.
5. It is very expensive to make the data marts consistent.

130) Explain the dependent data mart and operational data store architecture.
Answer:  The dependent data mart and operational data store architecture address some of the limitations of the independent data mart. Data is loaded from source data systems into a data staging area (called the operational data store). As part of this load process, the data are cleaned, reconciled, derived and transformed. The enterprise data warehouse is then loaded from the operational data store. Each individual data mart is loaded from the enterprise data warehouse. This is different from an independent data mart architecture, where each data mart is loaded from the data staging area. By having an enterprise data warehouse, the organization can maintain control of data quality and integrity by having one "gold standard," which is the enterprise data warehouse.

131) What is a logical data mart and what makes this architecture unique?
Answer:  A logical data mart is created by a relational view of a data warehouse. Some of the unique characteristics include:
1. Rather than having separate data marts, one can have several logical data marts which are only relational views of one physical data warehouse.
2. The data warehouse is used for cleansing and transformation rather than a separate staging area. 
3. New data marts can be created quickly. There is no need to create a new physical database or write any loading routines.
4. The logical data mart is always up to date because it is a view of the warehouse. The data warehouse only needs to be updated, since views are populated when used.

132) Discuss the three-layer data architecture.
Answer:  The three-layer data architecture describes how we view data in the data warehouse. The architecture is characterized by operational data, which is stored in various operational systems; reconciled data, which are stored in the enterprise data warehouse. Reconciled data are intended to be the single source for accurate data used by all decision support applications. Derived data are used by the data marts. It has been selected, formatted and aggregated for decision support applications.

133) What is the role of metadata in the three-layer data architecture?
Answer:  Metadata describe other data. There are three types of metadata used in the three-layer architecture:
1. Operational–describes the data in the operational systems that feed the enterprise data warehouse. May exist in different formats and is often poor quality.
2. Enterprise data warehouse metadata describe the reconciled data layer as well as the rules for extracting, transforming, and loading operational data into reconciled data.
3. Data mart metadata–describe the derived data layer and the rules for transforming reconciled data to derived data.

135) What is OLAP and what types of OLAP tools are available?
Answer:  OLAP stands for On-Line Analytical Processing. It is the use of a set of reporting and querying tools which allows the user to use simple windowing techniques to analyze multi-dimensional views of their data. The multi-dimensional view of the data can be thought of as a data cube. There are several variations of OLAP including: ROLAP (Relational OLAP) which uses SQL and view the database as a traditional relational database. MOLAP (Multi-dimensional OLAP) creates a data store where the data is viewed in its multi-dimensional format. Some less common tools are DOLAP, which builds OLAP into the query language, and HOLAP, which offers both multi-dimensional as well as relation query language access to the data.

136) Explain what the star schema is.
Answer:  The star schema is a simple database design. Dimensional (or descriptive) data are separated from fact or event data. The star schema consists of a fact table, which contains event data as well as links to dimensions. Dimension tables contain descriptive information. For example, we might have a dimension for sales territory which would have a unique ID as well as several levels of granularity. There might be a territory description, state, city, zip code, etc. The dimension key is also in the fact table. In this way, it is fairly simple to look up information and do some drill-down type queries.

137) What is the surrogate key rule for the star schema, and what are the main reasons for this rule?
Answer:  Each and every key used to join the fact table with a dimension table should be a surrogate key (meaning system-assigned) and not a key which uses a business value. The reasons that a surrogate key is required are the following:
1. Slowly, over time, business keys change. A surrogate key allows us to handle changing business keys easily.
2. Surrogate keys are shorter and simpler.
3. Surrogate keys can be the same length and format, regardless of the business dimension.

138) Explain a situation where multiple fact tables may be necessary.
Answer:  Multiple fact tables are useful in situations where different groups of users may need different sets of facts. One example would be a fact table to keep track of when a product is manufactured and another to keep track of when it is sold to a wholesaler. In this case, we may have two shared dimensions: date and product. These are called conformed dimensions.

139) When would it be appropriate to use factless fact tables?
Answer:  There are some situations where we would want to just keep keys to dimensions but no facts. One case would be a data warehouse to keep track of events, such as attendance in a course. Another case would be coverage, taking inventory of the set of possible occurrences.

140) What are some approaches to handling slowly changing dimensions?
Answer:  Dimensional data changes slowly over time. There are three possible ways to handle slowly changing dimensions:
1. Overwrite the current value with the new value. This is not an acceptable solution, since it eliminates the description of the past which might be needed to interpret some data.
2. If we know how many changes there will be, make a multi-valued attribute which will contain old values as dimensions change. This might make queries fairly complex, though.
3. Create a new dimensional table row each time the dimensional object changes. The surrogate key will contain the date.

141) What are some of the approaches to data integration?
Answer:  Data integration creates a unified view of business data. There are three approaches to data integration. The first approach, which is widely used in data warehousing, is consolidation. In this approach, data are loaded and transformed into a dataset useful for reporting or decision support. Another approach, data federation, provides a virtual view of integrated data without actually bringing the data into one database. The third approach, data propagation, duplicates data across databases.

142) Discuss the ETL process.
Answer:  The goal of the ETL process is data reconciliation. This data reconciliation occurs in two stages: when the data is initially loaded and when updates occur. There are five steps to the process of reconciliation (called the ETL process):
1. Mapping and metadata management–here the data needed for the warehouse are mapped back to the data in the operational system.
2. Extract–in this step, we capture any relevant data from the source system.
3. Cleanse–in this step, the data are cleansed so that things such as misspelled names, duplicate data, etc. are removed.
4. Load and Index–here the cleansed data are loaded into the data warehouse and appropriate indexes are created.

143) What are the characteristics of data after ETL?
Answer:  The goal of ETL is to provide a single, authoritative source for data that support decision making. Ideally, the data layer will have the following characteristics:
1. Detailed, providing maximum flexibility
2. Historical
3. Normalized–fully normalized to third normal form
4. Comprehensive

- misspelled names and addresses
- old formats for addresses
- impossible or invalid dates of birth
- fields used for purposes not intended
- missing data

146) In the load and index stage of ETL, what is the difference between refresh mode and update mode?
Answer:  Refresh mode is an approach to filling a data warehouse that involves bulk rewriting of the target data at periodic intervals. Initially, the warehouse is filled. Then, at periodic intervals, the warehouse is rewritten, replacing the previous contents. Update mode, on the other hand, only writes changes to the source data without overwriting old data.

147) Discuss data governance and what needs to be included in a data governance program.
Answer:  Data governance is a set of processes and procedures aimed at managing the data within an organization with an eye towards availability, integrity, and compliance with regulations. Data governance oversees security by providing data access policies. It also provides a mandate for dealing with data issues. A data governance program generally includes the following:
1. Sponsorship from senior management and business units
2. A data steward manager
3. Data stewards
4. A governance committee

149) What are the record-level data transformation functions?
Answer:  Record-level data transformation functions operate on a set of records, such as a file or a table. The most important record level functions are:
1. Selection–this is the process of partitioning data according to some pre-defined conditions
2. Joining–combines the data from several tables into a single view
3. Normalization–decomposing relations with anomalies
