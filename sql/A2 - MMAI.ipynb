Our previous data indicate that certain cytokines exert relatively long-term effects upon neurotransmitter activity and behaviours that appear to mimic those evident in clinical depression. More recently , evidence has been presented that cytokines also play a role in chronic degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's and other brain disease states. We suggest that a wide range of environmental toxins and even psychological stressors stimulate brain cytokines activity which, in turn, promotes the development of behavioural and neurological disturbances.\",\n",

Understanding how and why a magnetic field reverses is a central theme of the work. Magnetic fields help protect planetary surfaces from cosmic rays. Understanding the way these fields work could have implications for improving the safety of air travel.',\n",

When patients present with diabetes, it is often years after the disease onset.  Complications such a blindness, amputation, heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure are an ever-present threat for all patients with diabetes.  In both type 1 & 2 diabetes there is destruction of the insulin producing B cells which occur years before clinical presentation.  The objective of the proposed project is to better define the molecular events that trigger the destruction of the B cells which will lead to therapeutic targets for B cell preservation.',\n",

If these barriers are not thin enough to isolate components from oxidation and diffusion, particularly copper interconnects used in integrated circuits, the devices won’t work as effectively. With an Early Researcher Award, Dr. Tricia Carmichael of the University of Windsor will study self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), extremely thin organic films that form spontaneously on surfaces and could serve as barrier layers for future nano-electronic devices. Because SAMs are more effective on smooth surfaces, Dr. Carmichael will explore an industrial technique called “chemical-mechanical polishing” for polishing surfaces to nearly atomic ultrasmoothness.',\n",

Despite an abundance of literature on aging skeletal muscle, there is little information on the mechanism(s) underlying it. Ultimately, the development of new ways to counteract this loss depends entirely on our knowledge of these mechanisms. More than 15 per cent of Ontario’s population is 65 and older. This will increase by a third in the next 15 years.   Age-related health care costs are significant and rising. Effective strategies that promote independent, healthy living for an aging population will mean a better quality of life for Ontario’s older adults and lower pressure on provincial health care spending.',\n",

Treatment of infectious disease can be challenging, as microbes have an alarming ability to rapidly mutate and evolve, developing the ability to survive current antibiotic treatments. Researchers are conducting genomic and proteomic studies on a microscopic level to identify and understand the molecular mechanisms by which microbial pathogens cause infectious diseases. These pathogens are at the root of global pandemics that can result in widespread deaths. These studies strive for the prediction and prevention of these diseases.',\n",

       "    'Project Description': 'Sukhvinder Obi leads research studies on how the brain codes spatial information and how this coding helps in the production of purposeful, goal directed actions. The brain uses a number of reference points to code the position of an object, and this spatial information is necessary for the brain to program a successful action. For example, picking up a cup of coffee and taking a sip seems like the simplest of tasks. The complex neurological process of how the brain can codify the position of the cup and direct the hand correctly is still not fully understood.  A better understanding of how the process works will have implications for directing rehabilitation of brain injury victims, as well as better designs and training for those for whom accuracy of motion is critical, like pilots, dentists and surgeons.',\n",

Since we know very little about the parts of the brain that are affected in this condition, it is not yet curable. Dr. Agnes Wong leads a team at the Hospital for Sick Children seeking the answers to two questions: 1) Which parts of the brain are responsible for the slow-following eye movements typically found in crossed eyes? 2) How do the visual and eye movement systems interact to facilitate stereovision? The results will have important implications for the treatment or cure of a condition that affects one of every 100 children.',\n",

At the moment, more than 70 per cent of the bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections are resistant to at least one of the drugs most commonly used to treat them. Persons infected with drug-resistant organisms are more likely to have longer hospital stays and require treatment with second or third choice drugs that may be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive. As a result, there is now an urgent need to search for alternatives to synthetic antibiotics. Substances called antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are considered to be one of these alternatives. Dr. Anatoli Ianoul of Carleton University will use an Ontario Research Fund infrastructure award to establish new facilities to determine how AMPs act.  Once obtained, this information could be used to design a peptide with desired properties against a particular type of bacterium.',\n",

Chiral molecules are important because they are the building blocks of much of nature, for example, DNA, proteins, and sugars. Many chemical interactions, such as those between drugs and their specific targets in the body, depend upon recognizing the correct “hand” of a chiral molecule. The other mirror-imaged “hand” of a chiral molecule is not recognized and is rejected in a chemical interaction.  Dr. Nathan Jones and his team will use an Early Researcher Award to develop methods to selectively produce the proper “hands” of chiral molecules that are of pharmaceutical relevance.',\n",

With a better understanding of when resource constraints most inhibit individuals and families, public policy can be better targeted to alleviate deficiencies in investment throughout life. In addition, understanding why some workers experience little wage growth while others see their wages double over their careers is important to the design of income and employment assistance programs.',\n",

Chemicals like cannaboids (from marijuana), opioids (from heroin and morphine) and dopamine (a nervous system transmitter) are all active substances that influence brain receptors. These interactions are central themes in drug addiction and in age-related motor and cognitive decline. They are hoping what they learn will lead to novel and safe therapies by disrupting the coupling of the receptors with the substances. Xia Zhang and researchers at the University of Ottawa hope that this work will lead to treatments for drug addiction, and to offset some of the more pernicious effects of aging.',\n",

Over the last 20 years, many novel recombinant species that overproduce valuable proteins have been generated and legally protected for their great commercial potential. In order to convert them to viable commercial technologies, extensive studies such as this one are needed to develop the means to produce these proteins inexpensively, easily and in a fully functional form.',\n",

Dr. Darrell Desveaux and his research team at the University of Toronto will use an Early Research Award to explore the molecular details of the plant immune system, particularly how plants resist bacterial infection. Designing efficient disease control mechanisms requires a thorough understanding of pathogen virulence mechanisms and how the host responds to attempted infection. Many bacterial pathogens use type III secretion systems to infect and cause disease in hundreds of plant species.  Dr. Desveaux’s work will lead to an understanding of these secretion systems and ways to control plant disease and reduce the use of pesticides that can harm the environment.',\n",

In the last decade, the consequences of failing to protect the purity of groundwater supply have been demonstrated in such communities as Walkerton and Kashechewan. It has been estimated that 29 per cent of Canadians regularly consume groundwater, yet many groundwater sources are now contaminated beyond use. Clean-up is a significant challenge and new remediation technologies are urgently needed. In that context, a new Laboratory for the Development of Innovative Groundwater Remediation Strategies is to be established at the University of Western Ontario under the leadership of Dennis O’Carroll. One of the technologies Dr. O’Carroll and his colleagues will be researching involves pumping nanomaterials into the ground allowing them to flow with groundwater to a contaminated region and render the contaminants benign.',\n",

Mood disorders like stress and depression stall recovery from pain and add to such burdens as missed work and leisure. Dr. Eric Dumont of Queen’s University wants to improve the lives of people who suffer from pain by providing for better management of these mood disorders. He will use new equipment purchased with an infrastructure award from the Ontario Research Fund to visualize and measure brain cell activity in those parts of the brain that are involved in emotions. This research, which will lead to a clearer understanding of brain processes involved in the emotional aspects of pain, will result in a new drug and psycho therapies for better pain management and treatment.',\n",

Modern packaging can offer more than to simply passively protect food products. An emerging technology, known as active packaging, is designed to respond to the internal and/or package environment and actively carry out functions to extend shelf life. Another possibility lies in intelligent packaging, which possesses chemical and/or physical mechanisms that monitor the product and package condition and provide feedback (such as colour change) to reflect the state of the product. By combining the benefits of both approaches, an advanced packaging system can be achieved. The creation of these systems from such renewable materials as corn and soy proteins could offer both environmental and consumer benefits.',\n",

       "    'Project Description': 'This research program will focus on health-promoting bioactive compounds in foods, which when isolated chemically are called nutraceuticals. Delivered on their own or as supplements, nutraceuticals can help combat a variety of diseases including cancer.  However because many nutraceuticals are unstable and degrade quickly, they have limited utility. In addition, many are not effectively released during digestion and this limits the nutritional or therapeutic benefit. The Guelph team, led by Amanda Wright, seeks to determine how food ingredients should be structured to optimally encapsulate, stabilize and deliver nutraceuticals. Improved public health and greater global competitiveness for Canada’s $4 billion food industry are long-term advantages to such research.',\n",

The telescope will explore extra-solar planets, the first stars, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy with unprecedented power. Canada, through the LOT project, is one of four equal partners. TMT brings together much of the expertise and experience in large telescope construction in the world, with Canadians playing a central role.Ontario has much to gain from an exceptional project which is being discussed as a proto-type for rationalizing Canada’s approach to Big Science. The telescope will bring returns of scientific prestige, public profile, national pride, along with the demonstration of national intellectual and technical prowess that produces multiple returns for the research strength of the country, the ability to attract and retain talent, and considerable economic returns that are simply not available in any other way. Moreover, the significant access share will allow powerful Canadian/Ontario led scientific collaborations to emerge, crossing disciplinary, institutional, provincial and national boundaries. The University of Toronto leads the LOT/TMT project in Canada. The Canadian LOT science centre in Toronto will be a strong central resource for all Ontario university researchers using the telescope providing them privileged access to a facility of unmatched sensitivity and precision to illuminate a broad range of profound astrophysical problems. Moreover, the telescope should lead to 20-30 long term research positions in the province and approximately $100M of opportunities for joint university-industry work in high tech construction and instrumentation in electronics, optics, computing, steel fabrication, engineering analysis in situations rich with training opportunities and industrial innovation.',\n",

The basis of the scientific platform is the fact that many viruses use similar host functions as part of their infectious cycle. Therefore, drugs that inhibit these conserved functions have the potential to work against newly emerging viruses. The discovery and development of such “enhanced-spectrum” anti-virals is a major focus of the Consortium.',\n",

Significant amounts of time and money are spent in Ontario each year managing patients with this condition - and as the population ages, we can expect these costs to rise. Current medications are limited and sometimes have undesirable side effects. The Connexin40 gene was identified as a cause of atrial fibrillation in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Gollob, an assistant professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa. This new finding provides the opportunity to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind this condition with the goal of developing better medications for its management.',\n",

The countless diets and other strategies that people try have been only partially successful.  Researchers have found that after weight loss, many people quickly revert to their initial weight.  One explanation is that weight loss increases appetite.  Dr. Eric Doucet at the University of Ottawa will lead his research team in an investigation of how nutrition and exercise affect the hormones (blood-borne peptides) that play a key role in appetite control.  Dr. Doucet’s research could lead to new ways to take off weight and keep it off.',\n",

If these barriers are not thin enough to isolate components from oxidation and diffusion, particularly copper interconnects used in integrated circuits, the devices won’t work as effectively. With an Early Researcher Award, Dr. Tricia Carmichael of the University of Windsor will study self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), extremely thin organic films that form spontaneously on surfaces and could serve as barrier layers for future nano-electronic devices. Because SAMs are more effective on smooth surfaces, Dr. Carmichael will explore an industrial technique called “chemical-mechanical polishing” for polishing surfaces to nearly atomic ultrasmoothness.',\n",

A group of researchers at McMaster University led by Dr. Deda Gillespie is investigating how the immature auditory system organizes neural circuits. Their work will produce new insights into the development of auditory perception, with applications for a range of disorders from dyslexia to epilepsy.',\n",

With an Ontario Research Fund infrastructure award, Dr. Gianni Parise of McMaster University will equip a globally-competitive laboratory to study how age-related loss of muscle and strength happen and what can be done to treat it. Despite an abundance of literature on aging skeletal muscle, there is little information on the mechanism(s) underlying it. Ultimately, the development of new ways to counteract this loss depends entirely on our knowledge of these mechanisms. More than 15 per cent of Ontario’s population is 65 and older. This will increase by a third in the next 15 years.   Age-related health care costs are significant and rising. Effective strategies that promote independent, healthy living for an aging population will mean a better quality of life for Ontario’s older adults and lower pressure on provincial health care spending.',\n",

There will be a continued need for informed analysis and policy advice on the changing relationships between learning and work issues in Canada. A new infrastructure called Collaborative Inquiry Technology Environment information (CITE) will make it possible to develop a curriculum that is very interactive. Students will use technology tools to collect data, convert data into pictures, exchange files or design. There will be the capacity to conduct research in any environment without having to rely on school resources. The Ontario Research Fund infrastructure award will support the purchase of the technology to create technology frameworks that can be adapted and improved free of charge. The research will contribute to Ontario’s a role as a leader in the field of applying information technology to education. Research results will contribute to policy development on learning and work inter-relationships.',\n",

The complex neurological process of how the brain can codify the position of the cup and direct the hand correctly is still not fully understood.

These molecules are extraordinarily large. The bonds linking their atoms are almost 1,000 times longer than typical. Materials with exaggerated properties, like heavy Rydberg systems, can offer a myriad of technological benefits leading to new methods of information processing, or manufacture of semiconductor devices.   This research will foster a deeper understanding of how these systems are formed, and the ability to create large numbers on demand, and insights into how their properties can be studied and new uses uncovered.',\n",

At the moment, more than 70 per cent of the bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections are resistant to at least one of the drugs most commonly used to treat them. Persons infected with drug-resistant organisms are more likely to have longer hospital stays and require treatment with second or third choice drugs that may be less effective, more toxic, and more expensive. As a result, there is now an urgent need to search for alternatives to synthetic antibiotics. Substances called antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are considered to be one of these alternatives. Dr. Anatoli Ianoul of Carleton University will use an Ontario Research Fund infrastructure award to establish new facilities to determine how AMPs act.  Once obtained, this information could be used to design a peptide with desired properties against a particular type of bacterium.',\n",

These include necrotizing fasciitis (“flesh-eating disease”) and toxic shock syndrome. The high fatality rates and long recovery periods indicate that new therapies are required.  But a better understanding of streptococcal virulence is necessary to develop alterative treatments. Dr. John K. McCormick of the University of Western Ontario will study how a group of potent bacterial toxins (superantigens) produced from pathogenic streptococci and staphylococci interact with human white blood cells. This research will lead to new treatments for advanced stages of toxic shock syndrome, and anti-cancer therapies that will use immune cells to target specific tumours.',\n",

However, in some patients scarring is uncontrolled and can cause fibrotic disease, which can lead to organ failure and death. Approximately 35 per cent of health care costs in Canada are due to diseases involving fibrosis, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and liver cirrhosis.  Dr. Andrew Leask and his research team at the University of Western Ontario will study the causes of scleroderma, a chronic scarring disease affecting the skin and internal organs.  Dr. Leask’s research aims to identify specific proteins that can be targeted by therapeutic drugs to treat scarring in fibrotic diseases, but cause minimal side effects.',\n",

Dr. Murray says all 2D images are often highly ambiguous and these studies will examine what assumptions humans make about the shapes of objects in order to solve the difficult problem of recovering 3D shape from the 2D images on their retinas. Understanding these assumptions could lead to better human-machine interfaces, in tasks such as laparoscopic surgery, where perception of 3D shape from impoverished or unusual 2D images is crucial.',\n",

Dr. Aaron Schimmer and his research team at the University Health Network’s Ontario Cancer Institute will use an Early Researcher Award to investigate new therapies to improve this survival rate. They will study the over-expression of the X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (XIAP), which is associated with chemoresistance in patients with acute myeloid protein (AML).  Dr. Schimmer’s research will investigate agents that inhibit XIAP which could be used in treatment of the disease.',\n",

Clean-up is a significant challenge and new remediation technologies are urgently needed. In that context, a new Laboratory for the Development of Innovative Groundwater Remediation Strategies is to be established at the University of Western Ontario under the leadership of Dennis O’Carroll. One of the technologies Dr. O’Carroll and his colleagues will be researching involves pumping nanomaterials into the ground allowing them to flow with groundwater to a contaminated region and render the contaminants benign.',\n",

Cardiac arrest and stroke are the result of clots that block the flow of blood (ischemia) to portions of the heart and brain. During ischemia, cells sense a decrease in oxygen (hypoxia) through a process called protein hydroxylation. Dr. William Winmore leads a team of four researchers at Carleton University who will examine the role of hydroxylation in ischemic cardiovascular diseases and stroke.  Understanding this cellular response to hypoxia will provide insight into how cells recover from ischemic stress. Over the longer term, this will lead to new therapies for patient recovery from cardiac arrest and stroke.',\n",

Clinical evidence shows that women are more susceptible than men to sexually transmitted viruses such as herpes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and chlamydia.  But very little is known about why this is the case.  Dr. Charu Kaushic of McMaster University will use an Early Researcher Award to investigate how the female genital tract interacts with STI viruses and the immune system. The research done by Dr. Kauschic and her team will have an important impact on women’s reproductive health by helping to develop new vaccines, the most cost-effective way to control STIs',\n",

Modern packaging can offer more than to simply passively protect food products. An emerging technology, known as active packaging, is designed to respond to the internal and/or package environment and actively carry out functions to extend shelf life. Another possibility lies in intelligent packaging, which possesses chemical and/or physical mechanisms that monitor the product and package condition and provide feedback (such as colour change) to reflect the state of the product. By combining the benefits of both approaches, an advanced packaging system can be achieved. The creation of these systems from such renewable materials as corn and soy proteins could offer both environmental and consumer benefits.',\n",

The telescope will explore extra-solar planets, the first stars, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy with unprecedented power. Canada, through the LOT project, is one of four equal partners. TMT brings together much of the expertise and experience in large telescope construction in the world, with Canadians playing a central role.Ontario has much to gain from an exceptional project which is being discussed as a proto-type for rationalizing Canada’s approach to Big Science. The telescope will bring returns of scientific prestige, public profile, national pride, along with the demonstration of national intellectual and technical prowess that produces multiple returns for the research strength of the country, the ability to attract and retain talent, and considerable economic returns that are simply not available in any other way. Moreover, the significant access share will allow powerful Canadian/Ontario led scientific collaborations to emerge, crossing disciplinary, institutional, provincial and national boundaries. The University of Toronto leads the LOT/TMT project in Canada. The Canadian LOT science centre in Toronto will be a strong central resource for all Ontario university researchers using the telescope providing them privileged access to a facility of unmatched sensitivity and precision to illuminate a broad range of profound astrophysical problems. Moreover, the telescope should lead to 20-30 long term research positions in the province and approximately $100M of opportunities for joint university-industry work in high tech construction and instrumentation in electronics, optics, computing, steel fabrication, engineering analysis in situations rich with training opportunities and industrial innovation.',\n",

To address this, problem solving techniques in which the most appropriate solution is selected using rules -- known as heuristic techniques -- are widely applied in information and communications technology. The techniques are used in diverse areas that include natural resource management, telecommunications, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, retailing, and healthcare. At the University of Toronto, Dr. J. Christopher Beck will set up a research laboratory, to be funded by an ORF Research Infrastructure award, to develop an empirical science of heuristic search to address real-world problems.',\n",

Dr. James Fraser, an assistant professor in the Department of Physics, Engineering Physics and Astronomy at Queen's University, is building on that history by investigating carbon nanotubes, sheets of carbon atoms rolled into a tube with a diameter of one billionth of a meter. Their size provides them with intriguing optical and electronic properties but it also makes them hard to study. Dr. Fraser intends to create “movies” of how a single nanotube works on very fast time scales, which may lay the foundation for new optoelectronic devices that perform better and cost less to produce.\",\n",
